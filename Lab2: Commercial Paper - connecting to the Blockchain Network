This lab is a technical introduction to blockchain, specifically smart contract development using the latest developer enhancements in the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.

This lab is based on Hyperledger Fabric commercial paper tutorial, that can be found here:

Part I
In this lab, we will take you through connecting to an existing network, one that is running outside of in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The network we will be using is the ‘basic-network’ used by the “Commercial Paper” Hyperledger Fabric tutorial, and we will stand this network up, run through a simple version of the tutorial and then extend the network with a new smart contract transaction.

The scenario the tutorial follows is one of a commercial paper trading network called PaperNet. Commercial paper itself is a type of unsecured lending in the form of a “promissory note”. The papers are normally issued by large corporations to raise funds to meet short-term financial obligations at a fixed rate of interest. Once issued at a fixed price, for a fixed term, another company or bank will purchase them at a discount to the face value and when the term is up, they will be redeemed for their face value.
As an example, if a paper was issued at a face value of 10 million USD for a 6-month term at 2% interest then it could be bought for 9.8 million USD (10M – 2%) by another company or bank who are happy to bear the risk that the issuer will not default. Once the term is up, then the paper could be redeemed or sold back to the issuer for their full face value of 10 million USD. Between buying and redemption, the paper can be bought or sold between different parties on a commercial paper market.
These three key steps of issue, buy and redeem are the main transactions in a simplified commercial paper marketplace, which we will mirror in our lab. We will see a commercial paper issued by a company called MagnetoCorp, and once issued on the PaperNet blockchain network another company called DigiBank will first buy the paper and then redeem it.
In diagram form it looks like this:
